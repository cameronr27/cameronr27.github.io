This week I put more time into getting better at working with AWS. I created an s3 bucket for testing purposes and to
host a website. Using what we have learned in class I knew that I could host a static webpage with this method. I started by naming the
bucket to be the same as the Domain name. In the properties section of the bucket I clicked the static website hosting option and 
entered index.html for the index.  I did this twice, once by using the GUI and commandline. 
< aws s3 website s3://www.camseniordesignblog.com/ --index-document index.html --error-document error.html > Is what I entered to successfully
create this. When that was finished an S3 url was created that routes to the website through the new url. Next step was to edit the permissions
under the public settings tab. I had to enter a policy by entering this aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket www.camseniordesignblog.com --policy file://policy.json
I uploaded files for the webpage onto the bucket and was able to view my website by visiting the newly created URL. If I were to actually
use this website I would change the access rules by not allowing everyone in the world to be able to access it, currently I have it that
way with no security. The process was relatively simple and gave me insight on other options to host websites.
