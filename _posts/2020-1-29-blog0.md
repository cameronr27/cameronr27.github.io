This week we learned about bout Docker, a cloud based repository and its practical use of handling containers. Docker allows the users to push and pull containers efficiently. We had to create a user account to take advantage of the docker services, I never had one so I had to create one.

Once account creation was finished our class quickly went over how use docker and what its functions are over a web conference. To start an interactive docker terminal I have to use the command <docker run -it>, I had to get familiar with the new flags. We were also taught that docker installs barebone iso files, this means we have to install any packages that we need before we can even use Docker efficiently.

I had to familiarize myself with commands using online documentation after learning how the general command line syntax worked in class, specifying a docker container was giving me issues because of all the different flags you can use, for an example: <docker run -it cit481 centos /bin/bash> looked confusing at first. I now know that cit481 is the tag and centOS being the actual VM when typing that syntax. These two names are important because it helps not only identifying which docker will be selected but also how to remove them.
