This week I focused on getting familiar with the AWS command line. For the labs I would previously just use the website to navigate
through all of the services to complete the lab, I felt learning the CLI would help me advance my experience and knowledge when it 
comes ot using AWS. To start I install the CLI by using this command <aws configure> it will ask for information to complete the
configuration. One of the commands i used was <aws ec2 describe-instances> to gather information about the ec2 instances we created
in our labs. Another command I learned was <ws ec2 start-instances> which speaks for itself on starting an already created ec2 instance.
Once going over the ec2 commands I focused on the S3 bucket commands since we had to create one in a previous lab. To start 
I used the command <aws s3api help> to see what was relevant to me. I learned that <s3 mb> will allow you to create a bucket
from the command line so i played with that. Using the command <aws s3 ls s3:// (bucket name)> will allow you to view 
the contents within it. Lastly I gained experience with the <s3 sync <source> <target>> This allows me to synchronize contents of an S3
Folder to the current working directory. After learning the CLI and getting comfortable with it I felt that I understood AWS much better
and how it functions.
