This week my team focused on getting better with using Vuetify. We learned how to incorporate other components on our web pages.
We made great progress on the website we are creating for the other groups. Modified the index.js file to link users to the correct path.
Path:'/Projects' Path"'/about' was put into the file to allow the correct routing to the corresponding web page. We incorporated Navbar.vue
to add some style to our page and give better web navigation. Many other components were added since we built this from scratch.
We created a homepage that uses the <v-img> aand <v-button> components. Our project page is alot more elaborate as it has many more components
we used icons and <v-card> to allow each team to have their own section with their own project descriptions and bio.
