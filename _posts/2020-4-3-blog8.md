This week I used the Linux distro SecurityOnion. I learned its process of how it is able to sniff out intrusions on a desired network.
What I did to get familiar with SecurityOnion was to have a virtual instance of Kali Linux open at the same time as SecurityOnion. I 
used Armitage to and selected the vsftpd_234_backdoor exploit to attack the network that SecurityOnion was on. Once the attack was initiated
I opened Sguil which is a realtime network monitoring app on the SecurityOnion instance. The Sguil shows what packets are being sniffed on the network
that could contain potential harm. Once I located the attack that I did for study purposes I had to study packet data and how it pertains
to the IP address listed in the GUI. I was able to detect other attacks that I did and defend the system from being targeted and harmed.
