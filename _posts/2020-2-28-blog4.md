This week was focused on creating a MySQL server for the expired senior design team. Myself and my partner hugo talked to professor Fitzgerald 
about which proper directions to follow in order to complete the setup. We were given access to the techlab demo virtual machine which 
already had mySQL set up. We had to research about the .cnf file and make make changes to it in order for the server to be ran properly.
Everything seems to be set up correctly but we ran into the same issue that we have with the other virtual machines. Trying to ssh into
it will not work and even professor Fitzgerald was having issues connecting to it. Hugo and I also had a zoom meeting with professor Lisa
on creating a virtual machine, during the call she guided us through the steps to create the VM successfully. We still had an issue on 
using ssh, we are not sure on what could be the issue. During this time I am trying my best to research potential errors and what a 
possible solution could be. I have been focusing on the /etc environment and network interfaces files to see what I can possibly do.
