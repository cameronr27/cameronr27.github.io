This week we made the final touches for our senior design website. We went through the process of implementing a different navigation bar, various 
changes to the ui, and inserting non copyright images. We had to do a lot  of non technical tasks at the same time such as communicating
with all of the groups to get even more detailed info when it comes to the technologies they used to create their project. The project
section of the website was refined by rescaling the <v-cards> that links to the selected project. We also used href addresses to link
to everyones github account to the respective page of the team. I was able to create a "go to top" <v-btn> just to add more flair to the 
website but we decided to not implement it, instead we wanted to keep the website close to the actual CSUN homepage. We updated the <footer>
component to have the Csun seal and school address to be on all pages by using javascript so we did not have to recreate the same code for
all pages. The last thing we did was install another library, we used vuex because it allowed us to pass data from one of our created
parent components. The whole process was enjoyable we both agreed that our methods to the webpage creation not only improved our 
developing skills,  but we also are now able to work on side projects because of how much we have grown.
