This week was a bit difficult to be as technical as I would have liked to because of the coronavirus pandemic. Besides that my group focused 
on preparing for the presentation and learning Vue framework because it is relevant to my groups senior design project. 
We are creating a website for all of the groups that goes into detail on what the members and what their project is about. 
Myself and Hugo have a basic understanding of HTML/CSS we agreed that we could learn vue  to further our skills. We  created a powerpoint
to go into detail about what we have been able to learn/accomplish so far. The slides we created focused on KVM, LDAP, and what services
we could help others with. Outside of the presentation we learned how to use Vue. Started with installing the prerequisites conisting of a LAMP stack,
VUE CLI and NodeJS package manager. The command used to install vue cli <npm install -g @vue/cli>. Once we had everything installed
we learned the structure of a vue file and both agreed that we we would implement vue in our HTML files by useing a <div> tag. We 
focused on understanding the <script> and <style> tags to enter relevant data needed. Once that was done we created a component 
in the src/components location. We both worked on the website together and we were able to show a demo of it during our presentation.
